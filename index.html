                        <h3>Artist statement</h3>
                        <p>The objective of this project was to create a new narrative video by re-editing the visual and audio components of two completely unconnected videos. The basic tone of the video is creepy and terrifying, and it centers on a collection of horror stories that are brought on by phone calls. Understanding the film and audio material as a whole was crucial for the production process. To see how the two seemingly unconnected videos were connected, I continued to watch the video. Even though this approach had to be a little tedious, seeing the videos helped me make the decision to create a video with a horror theme. After completing the basic planning, I formally began the editing process. I think carefully and logically during the entire editing process, and I have to ask myself questions all the time. What does this picture in this frame mean? Does connecting the two clips make sense? My first video showcasing my artistic individuality is this one. Nevertheless, it is childish and has errors. But I value it greatly. Since it was the first time I had translated a concept from my thoughts into reality, I was proud and delighted when I finished all the clips and clicked play.</p>

                        <p>Many lovely things immediately came to mind when I saw the theme Calm, which led me to decide there and then to create icons using it as the theme. There is always something that will make you feel tranquil and sleepy when you see it, hear it, or feel it. The goal of the work is to represent these items as icons so that the audience can likewise experience their beauty when they see them. I truly enjoy the process of creating icons, whether it involves meticulously sketching vector graphics, painstakingly coordinating colors, or brainstorming sketch ideas. My thoughts turning into reality is a sensation I genuinely enjoy. To make the icon stand out and capture attention, I focused on using warm, low-saturation hues for the color scheme and boosted the brightness between colors. In keeping with the notion of "Clam," we decided against outlining the form to lessen the overall stimulus of the emblem to the audience. The selection and development of the audio and HTML presented some challenges for me. First of all, I had to hunt for relevant resources online because I had no idea how to generate sounds. Second, I had no prior experience with programming. However, these challenges also helped me identify how I might continue to develop. Learning and conquering obstacles are tedious but worthwhile processes. I believed the project to be flawless when I had just finished it. I had more to think about after reading my mentor's feedback on the project and realizing that it could have been done better.</p>
