                            <p>The objective of this project was to create a new narrative video by re-editing the visual and audio components of two completely unconnected videos. The basic tone of the video is creepy and terrifying, and it centers on a collection of horror stories that are brought on by phone calls. Understanding the film and audio material as a whole was crucial for the production process. To see how the two seemingly unconnected videos were connected, I continued to watch the video. Even though this approach had to be a little tedious, seeing the videos helped me make the decision to create a video with a horror theme. After completing the basic planning, I formally began the editing process. I think carefully and logically during the entire editing process, and I have to ask myself questions all the time. What does this picture in this frame mean? Does connecting the two clips make sense? My first video showcasing my artistic individuality is this one. Nevertheless, it is childish and has errors. But I value it greatly. Since it was the first time I had translated a concept from my thoughts into reality, I was proud and delighted when I finished all the clips and clicked play.</p>

                            <p>Many lovely things immediately came to mind when I saw the theme Calm, which led me to decide there and then to create icons using it as the theme. There is always something that will make you feel tranquil and sleepy when you see it, hear it, or feel it. The goal of the work is to represent these items as icons so that the audience can likewise experience their beauty when they see them. I truly enjoy the process of creating icons, whether it involves meticulously sketching vector graphics, painstakingly coordinating colors, or brainstorming sketch ideas. My thoughts turning into reality is a sensation I genuinely enjoy. To make the icon stand out and capture attention, I focused on using warm, low-saturation hues for the color scheme and boosted the brightness between colors. In keeping with the notion of "Clam," we decided against outlining the form to lessen the overall stimulus of the emblem to the audience. The selection and development of the audio and HTML presented some challenges for me. First of all, I had to hunt for relevant resources online because I had no idea how to generate sounds. Second, I had no prior experience with programming. However, these challenges also helped me identify how I might continue to develop. Learning and conquering obstacles are tedious but worthwhile processes. I believed the project to be flawless when I had just finished it. I had more to think about after reading my mentor's feedback on the project and realizing that it could have been done better.</p>

                            <p>The main character is transported from the actual world to the park of his youth when, as a result of the power of the magic tree, he falls through the magic hole. The general setting is divided into two scenes: the park in the past and the park in the present, and the 3D environment's overall design is "low poly." Cool tones, low saturation colors, low lighting, and quiet sound are the defining characteristics of layer 1's environment. The environment of layer 2 is distinguished by warm tones and high saturation colors; the light is warm and bright; the sound is joyful and full of wonder.The primary difference between layer one's environment and layer two's is intended to heighten the realism of the audience crossing while also adding a sense of magic to layer two. Programming and 3D modeling presented some challenges for me. Since I don't know how to create 3D models, I first had to hunt for them in the Unity store. In terms of scripting, there were many little issues that arose while the environment was operating, necessitating frequent script modifications. Occasionally, it took a while to address a minor issue. Even though there are many obstacles, I usually feel really satisfied after overcoming an issue.</p>

                <p>During the three months of this training, I have learned a lot. Although the process has been heartbreaking, it has also been enjoyable. I enjoyed working on my project in the library with my friends; I enjoyed the feedback I received from my teachers and classmates; I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment and happiness I experienced when I finished my project; I enjoyed talking with my friends about the outcomes and evaluation; and I enjoyed the sensation that my ideas were coming to fruition.When I made Assignment 1, I improved my Pr skills and knowledge of how to merge audio and video. It didn't upset me for a long time, and it probably taught me not to worry too much about the grade but to do my best with the project, even though I didn't get a good mark since I didn't read the assignment requirements. I gained knowledge of AI, composition, color matching, and a variety of other interaction design elements while working on Assignment 2. I greatly appreciated the advise my friends gave me when I spoke with them. When I turned in the project, I thought I had done an excellent job, but my mentor's suggestions also caused me to think more deeply about it.From the beginning, when I knew nothing about Unity as a 3D program, to the finish, when I could assist my classmates in solving Unity problems, I learnt a lot. Overall, I had a great time during this semester. I've developed more self-control, a stronger desire to collaborate with others and interact with them, and a deeper love for life.</p>
